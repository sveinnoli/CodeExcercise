# Google foobar invitation level 2 challenge part 1.

The files largest_number_divby3 and largest_number_divby3_v2 are solutions to the challenge. As of right now only largest_number_divby3_v2 manages to solve the problem, where as the second file was an attempt at optimizing the solution for lists of large values. 

The other files largest_sum_div3 and largest_sum_div3_v2 are solutions i made after incorrectly assessing the problem, I assumed they wanted to find the biggest sum that was evenly divisible by 3 and return the numbers that resulted in said sum.

The main.py program was to compare two "algorithms" and see if they gave the correct result and in general just to test any other algorithm against one that is 100% guaranteed to work.
